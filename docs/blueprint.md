## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated magenta (#FF00FF) to capture the fun and energetic aspects of the app, providing a modern and playful feel. 
- Background color: Light pink (#FFE5F2), a desaturated version of the primary color, offering a soft contrast that keeps the interface bright but not overwhelming.
- Accent color: Violet (#8000FF), an analogous color to magenta, used to draw attention to important interactive elements and highlight key information.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif), which gives a personalized and stylish vibe to the titles, matching the app's playful artistic intent; Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) which complements Belleza with a readable font for the keywords and UI elements
- Use rounded and bubbly icons related to keyword categories such as animals, actions, and styles to enhance the cheerful aesthetic.
- Implement animated transitions and fun loading animations, such as paint splashes or spinning rubber chickens, to provide feedback and amuse users during image generation.
